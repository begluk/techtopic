The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is the newest device in the company's Surface Pro lineup. The Surface Pro tablets are advertised as a 2-in-1 solution. They combine both the flexibility of a tablet and the power of a laptop into one device. This lineup is mostly meant for workloads such as office work, watching videos or streaming movies, surfing the web, color-accurate workloads such as art, and many more use cases. This new Surface Pro came with many improvements over the previous device, the Surface Pro 7. For the first time, we see higher refresh rates being used. The Surface Pro 8 comes with a 120 Hz refresh rate, making the usage much more snappy and smooth. Although the newest device isn't using the latest 12th gen Intel processors, the 11th gen processors still pack a punch. It still comes with the iconic Kickstand and detachable Keyboard with built-in Slim Pen storage and charging. The new 13" display is larger than the previous display, making the Surface Pro 8 truly the best Surface Pro ever.

## Design

The Surface Pro 8's design is quite an improvement over the previous revisions, while still keeping the same style. At dimensions measuring 11.3x8.2x0.37 inches and a weight of 1.96 pounds, the Surface Pro 8’s slim and lightweight design makes it a convenient portable device. The dark anodized casing makes the design quite eye-pleasing. There are 2 cameras on the device, one on the back and another one on the front. On the bottom, there is a connector for Microsoft's Surface Pro keyboard. The bigger display size means that the bezels are thinner, and that makes the experience a bit more immersive. Overall, we found the Surface Pro 8's design quite pleasing, and the compactness certainly is a bonus in a work environment.



## Display

One of the main selling points of this device is the display. The 13" PixelSense™ Flow Display has a higher resolution than the previous version, as to keep the image crisp and clear with the bigger screen size. It still has the same pixel density of 267 PPI.  For the first time, the Surface Pro lineup got into the high refresh rate market with a 120 Hz display, but 120 Hz is pretty much considered standard now. The tablet supports GPU Ink Acceleration which optimizes the Windows Ink experience quite a lot. It also comes with Dolby Vision® support for all of those interested. Adaptive color support is finally available, improving both image quality and battery life. Microsoft advertises color brightness to be at 450 nits. Microsoft still uses IPS technology, which is more color accurate, but the blacks are not completely black. Overall the display is well fitted for all kinds of workloads, and the experience does not degrade with different viewing angles. 

## Performance

The Surface Pro 8 comes with multiple options for the hardware.
It is available in versions with the following processors:
Quad-core 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-1135G7 Processor
Quad-core 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1185G7 Processor
In most workloads, the difference between them is not very noticeable. However, if you use programs that require better specifications, we would recommend the i7. For 3D workloads such as Blender, we would not recommend this device for heavier rendering, but it is a great choice when it comes to 3D modeling. It comes with Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics, which is enough for most 3D and art workloads, and even a bit of gaming.  

#### RAM

The device uses LPDDR4x RAM and comes in 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB versions. Although 8GB is still plenty enough for most workloads, we would not recommend 8GB if you want a future-proof experience.

#### Storage

As for storage goes, the Surface Pro 8 is available in 512GB and 1TB versions. It also comes with a removable SSD slot that supports 128GB and 256GB drives.

## Battery

The Surface Pro 8 advertises its battery life at "16 hours of typical device usage", but we still had to test that. The tested battery life was around 10-12 hours of normal usage. That's not too far off from the advertised battery life, but still more than enough for a whole day of light office work. Nominal battery capacity is measured at 51.5Wh.

## Video calling

The device comes with a 5.0MP front-facing camera with 1080p full HD video. Its quality met our criteria for what's a good video calling experience. We saw minimal fuzzy spots in darker conditions and overall both the front and back-facing cameras performed well. It has dual far-field mics. The microphone quality in a call is typical of what's expected from a compact 2-in-1 of this size. 

## Ports

The Surface Pro 8 comes with 2 USB-C ports with USB 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4 capabilities. It also includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is great, seeing many manufacturers seem to be leaving this beloved headphone jack out. There's also the Surface Connect port, used for the Surface Dock, which gives you many more I/O options.

## Software

The release date of this device was not a coincidence. With the release of Windows 11, so did the Surface Pro 8 come out. It comes with Windows 11 Home, preloaded with all your beloved office 365 apps, and a 1 month free trial for Microsoft 365 Family. It also came preloaded with the Xbox app. Oh and, they also include a 1 month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate trial.

Overall the Microsoft Surface 8 met our expectations of what was next, although the release of Windows 11 was kind of unexpected. We hope that this post helped you decide whether the Surface Pro 8 is for you. If so, the purchase links are right here:
