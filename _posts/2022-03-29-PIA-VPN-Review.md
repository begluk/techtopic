A VPN is a tool that encrypts all of your data, and hides your IP from potentially malicious sites. This ensures no one can see what you browse, not even your ISP. A good VPN is something everyone needs, whether it is to bypass geolocation restrictions, hide your IP, protect your privacy, or even block ads. Private Internet Acess (PIA) offers all of these and much more. Founded in 2009, PIA is a well established VPN company. Unlike many other VPNs in this price range, PIA offers a lot of premium features at very competitive prices. For a small price of $2.19 a month for a 3 year plan, you get ad-blocking, port forwarding, a dedicated IP, split-tunneling, multi-hop and much more!

PIA keeps no logs of your online browsing, and they have proven that in court. They take privacy and security of you and your credentials very seriously. It boasts really fast speeds, faster than you'll ever need. From our testing, PIA VPN, despite being one of the oldest standing VPN services, is still one of the strongest competitors, both quality wise and price wise. 

Pricing

PIA is more budget friendly than most other VPNs at this quality. Their pricing plans are not that complicated:

- $9.95 for 1 month
- $39.95 for 1 year ($3.33 monthly)
- $79 for 3 years ($2.19 monthly)
