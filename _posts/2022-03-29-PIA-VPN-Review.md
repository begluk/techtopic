A VPN is a tool that encrypts all of your data, and hides your IP from potentially malicious sites. This ensures no one can see what you browse, not even your ISP. A good VPN is something everyone needs, whether it is to bypass geolocation restrictions, hide your IP, protect your privacy, or even block ads. Private Internet Acess (PIA) offers all of these and much more. Founded in 2009, PIA is a well established VPN company. Unlike many other VPNs in this price range, PIA offers a lot of premium features at very competitive prices. For a small price of $2.19 a month for a 3 year plan, you get ad-blocking, port forwarding, a dedicated IP, split-tunneling, multi-hop and much more!

PIA keeps no logs of your online browsing, and they have proven that in court. They take privacy and security of you and your credentials very seriously. It boasts really fast speeds, faster than you'll ever need. From our testing, PIA VPN, despite being one of the oldest standing VPN services, is still one of the strongest competitors, both quality wise and price wise. 

## Pricing

PIA is more budget friendly than most other VPNs at this quality. Their pricing plans are not that complicated:

- $9.95 for 1 month
- $39.95 for 1 year ($3.33 monthly)
- $79 for 3 years ($2.19 monthly)

## Prviacy

Privacy is the main focus of VPNs. PIA scores very high for privacy. Its applications use OpenVPN and WireGuard, two of the latest, most secure VPN protocols. OpenVPN uses AES-128 encryption by default, but you can bump that up to AES-256 in the settings. You can set the data authentication methods, including RSA-2048 and RSA-4096. PIA uses their own DNS server to minimize the chances of a DNS leak. PIA also automatically switches your connection off whenever it fails to connect to the VPN. You also get the option to block trackers, ensuring you stay safe online.

PIA's apps are open source, so you can be sure to have control over any data collect about you. This also means other developers can contribute to the apps, to fix bugs quickly.

## Performance

PIA scores very high when it comes to VPN internet speed. We managed to score speeds as high as 500mbps. They have servers all around the globe, ensuring low latency at all times. We saw no degradation of internet browsing and online gaming performance with the VPN on. Their applications are lightweight and ensure you won't get any slowdowns even on older computers.

Although this VPN was not created for streaming, we saw that it does well with unblocking geo-restricted content.

## The apps

PIA has apps for any platform you can image. From Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, to even consoles and Smart TV. We have found their apps to be very user friendly.

In the application, you can change your location to any of their servers, tweak advanced settings, port forwarding and many more interesting options.
