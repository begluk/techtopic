PureVPN had a good year in 2021. It redesigned its apps, began implementing the WireGuard protocol, and relocated its headquarters from Hong Kong to the British Virgin Islands. We'll go into the specifics later, but to summarize, this is a VPN service that has received a lot of recent upgrades.If you're unfamiliar with PureVPN, it's worth noting that it's one of the more well-known services, having been in operation since 2007. It may not be as well-known as NordVPN or have as many servers, but neither of these factors should be used to dismiss it. But don't worry, we'll introduce you to PureVPN, a provider that provides executive services, in our full review.

### What can you expect from PureVPN?

PureVPN is a fast VPN that has received largely excellent feedback. It has robust data encryption, a large number of secure protocols, and features for seamless torrenting and streaming, making it an excellent VPN for media consumption. PureVPN's detractors, on the other side, point to its uneven speed results and poor security reputation.

You can expect:
- AES-256 encryption
- Unblocks many streaming services
- Port Forwarding
- 30 days money back gurantee
- Torrenting is supported
- Streaming services with PureVPN

Although PureVPN is not the best VPN for streaming, it can unblock content from various countries depending on the server you connect to. Only a slow connection can create the difficulty, which can be caused by a demand on the servers.

## Netflix and other services 

PureVPN can be used to access geo-restricted Netflix content. Some customers say that when they use this VPN, Netflix does not load at all. However, your experience may vary based also on tunneling protocol, the server used, and your browser.
We also tested other services, such as BBC iPlayer, DAZN, YouTube and others. PureVPN has also successfully unblocked content from them. As a result, PureVPN is a great option for unblocking content on streaming services.

## PureVPN Servers

In terms of server count, PureVPN appears to be able to compete with even the most popular VPNs, since it has 6500 servers in 78 countries.
Here is the list of PureVPN servers:

| Location        | Server count  |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Europe          | 2,750 servers |
| North America   | 1,788 servers |
| Central America | 15 servers    |
| South America   | 171 servers   |
| Asia            | 576 servers   |
| Oceania         | 451 servers   |
| South America   | 171 servers   |
| Africa          | 124 servers   |

## PureVPN Speed

With OpenVPN UDP, PureVPN demonstrated remarkable speed test results: several locations had minor download speed drop-offs. When connected to a Swiss server, for example, the speed reduced by only 17% compared to the baseline. Upload speeds, on the other side, fell a little more.
PureVPN Performance

PureVPN also provides us with the WireGuard protocol, which allows for very high speeds. This is one of the things that PureVPN introduced after its series of upgrades in 2021. When WireGuard is selected, however, some functions, such as split tunneling and the dedicated IP option, will not be available. In the meanwhile, IKEv2 was significantly quicker than OpenVPN TCP, but it was also significantly less reliable. Furthermore, OpenVPN TCP has a significant negative influence on speed, making it one of the least effective alternatives for longer distances.

## PureVPN Pricing

PureVPN offers very low and affordable costs for everyone, as it breaks several records and outperforms many VPN services that are more expensive.

- 2-year plan: **$1.99/month**
- 1-year plan: **$2.99/month**
- Monthly: **$10.95/month**
