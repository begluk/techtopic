The perfect gaming setup is a unique combination of hardware and software. Gamers are constantly looking for ways to enhance their experience, whether it be by purchasing the latest controller or graphics card, or by finding new games that provide an intense and immersive gameplay experience.

A gaming setup can be a very personal thing. Different people prefer different game genres, so of course they are going to want to play on the hardware that best supports their tastes. Some gamers prefer laptops over desktops because they tend to be more mobile and easier to travel with, while others may prefer them as secondary desktops for when they're away from home. Likewise, some people like large displays for their main computers while others feel that monitors that are too big are just wasted space. 

There are countless features involved in gaming, some of which include: audio, video, ergonomics, comfort and even lighting. With such diverse needs, it can be difficult to find all the right accessories without breaking your budget. So we've compiled a list of five gadgets every gamer should have on their wish list this year

## 1. Cable Clips

A cable clip is a simple, low-cost device that keeps cables organized. The main purpose of the cable clip is to hold wires or a cable in place, but it can also serve as a hanger for headphones, charging cables or small flashlights. Cable clips are made of plastic and metal and are generally inexpensive to manufacture.

Cable clips are used specifically for keeping wires from falling down in a tangled mess. Cable clips can also be used to keep them from getting damaged by sharp edges or corners. Cable clips will also prevent your wires from being stepped on or running into door frames and other hard objects.

A headphone stand is a simple desktop item that helps you keep your desk organized and neat. Every headphone type has its own place to be put on, which makes the headphone stand an ideal way to keep your earphones from getting tangled.

Headphone stands also prevent headphones from being damaged by accidental falls, since the headphones are suspended in mid-air instead of being placed on the desktop directly. This makes them ideal for home and office use alike.
