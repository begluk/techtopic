In November 2020, Sony released PS5. The console itself is powerful and well designed. In comparison to the older generation of PlayStation it brings new and more powerful hardware, so gaming In 4K and 120 fps will be easier than ever. The only bad thing we found in design is that console can be a little too big for some setups, but ultra-fast SSD and powerful cooling system justify that. Now about the interface, it is clean and user-friendly. We found no problem navigating around, and were pleasantly surprised with its simplicity, but still keeping that gaming look. It goes for $499.99, which is a pretty fair price. But if it’s still a little too much for your budget, there is a PS5 digital edition that comes without drive, but for only $399.99. 

## Games

PlayStation 5 launched with a decent amount of games. For example Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Devil May Cry 5, and Demon’s Souls. The only problem, for now, is that you don’t need PS5 to play most of these games. But again PS5 brings improved graphics, and there is a word about some new titles coming this season. For this price, we think this is more than a decent lineup of great titles to play.

## Design

When we talk about design, the console itself is a little too big for our taste, but as we already said, a great cooling system and staying quiet even in most brutal action scenes in 4K justify this. Dimensions are 5.4 x 10.2 x 4.1-inch. Its vertical position looks gorgeous,  but we were worried about tipping over so we mostly kept it in a horizontal position, where it still looks like a machine worthy of every penny put into it. It comes in with white panels, but as we heard there is the possibility to change them to black, and both options are just killing it.

## Performance

For this “killing machine” Sony put some serious effort.
It comes with an 8-core AMD Zen 2 (3.5 GHz) CPU, which in combination with  10.3 teraflop RDNA 2 GPU and 16GB of RAM just smash everything you put out for this beast. When we talk about storage, it comes with an 825GB SSD, which can be too small for someone, but there is always an option for an upgrade in the look of an external SSD. It has USB type A and C in front, and in the back, it has SuperSpeed USB type A, an Ethernet jack, and HDMI 2.1 as well as an AC adapter. Its interface just runs so smooth on this, as well as there is a 120Hz option. In the end, if you find yourselves buying this console you will just enjoy it as we did.
