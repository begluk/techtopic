We finally got Apple's newest product, the iPhone SE 2022, which is also the cheapest in the company's line-up. The iPhone 8 design has been used for this phone, however this time it is powered by an A15 Bionic chip. The iPhone SE is now available for purchase for $429. The phone is similar to its predecessor, as well as the iPhone 8, in terms of design, it also has the same processor as the iPhone 13. 5G compatibility and a larger battery are two of the new features. This model's camera is superior to its predecessor, and the difference is immediately apparent. However, while purchasing an iPhone SE, one thing to keep in mind is that for an additional $ 160, you can get a iPhone 12 Mini, which features a new modern design and two cameras on the back of the phone. The biggest difference between the iPhone 12 Mini and the iPhone SE 2022 may be the larger screen and the fact that it is significantly lighter. Of course, the iPhone SE has a speedier processor than the iPhone 12 Mini, which may be significant.

## Design

The iPhone SE 2022, as previously said, has a design that is identical to that of the iPhone 8. However, the phone's exterior appears to have been improved; only the case is made of metal, but it is very smooth to operate. On the rear of the phone, there is only one 12MP wide-angle camera. Apple has ensured that there are no consumer complaints about the iPhone SE 2022, as there were with the iPhone 13 due to the sharp edges. The iPhone SE 2022 has nearly no corners, as was the case with the iPhone 13. The frame itself weighs roughly 144 grams. The phone's screen resolution is 1344x750 pixels, which is not bad for a phone of this size. On the front of the phone, there is a 7MP camera. There's also the original Touch ID button, which is still one of the best biometric authorisation methods available. Because, no matter what position your fingerprint is in when the phone detects it, the reader will readily register it every time.
Display

Speaking of the screen itself, the iPhone SE has a 4.7-inch screen, but nothing special. Since today we can see much better screens from various phone manufacturers, the iPhone SE does not seem anything special when it comes to the screen because it has an LCD of only 60Hz. However, of course, the screen serves a purpose and is far from being bad. It can be used to surf the web, playing games as well as watching videos.  As far as iPhone SE protection is concerned, there is no need to worry so much. Since the iPhone 8 had problems with breakage, this is not the case with the iPhone SE 2022. Although it has the same body as the iPhone 8, it has a front and back made of the same type of stand used on the rear of the iPhone 13. But it would not be desirable to get yourself silicone protection because your phone doesn't have Apple's protection technology called "Ceramic Shield".

It was not hard to realize this idea, which consists of fitting a new powerful Apple A15 Bonic processor into the design created around three years ago, because Apple is one of the few firms that creates practically all components on its own. During our studies, we discovered that there isn't much of a processing difference between the iPhone 13 small and the iPhone SE. The A15 Bionic chip, on the other hand, elevates this phone to a higher level because it can record 4K video and play games without issue. It's also worth noting that, unlike previously, the phone now has 4GB of RAM, which will alter the device's speed. Another thing to keep in mind is that this phone, like the latest Apple models, now supports 5G.

## Battery

Due of its compact size, the battery within the iPhone SE 2022 may cause issues for some users and will not last long. Although the A15 Bionic has a big impact on the phone's performance, it will not be useful in this situation. If you use the phone frequently, as well as if you play games on it, the battery will quickly be depleted. If you are a frequent user, however, you should not be concerned because this phone will match your needs.  Another issue is the poor charging speed, as this phone only has an 18W charger, which is disappointing given that Android phones have much faster chargers. Apple's new MagSafe chargers are also incompatible.
Pricing

The iPhone SE 2022 is now available in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Unlike its predecessor, the price has been raised due to enhancements and only the A15 Bionic chip. However, when it comes to Apple's 5G phones, this still makes it the most cheap. The iPhone SE costs $429, but we only get 64GB of storage, which may not be enough for some, so you can upgrade to a 128GB model for $479 or a 256GB model for $579. However, we propose that you consider purchasing the iPhone 13 model, which comes with a 128 GB base model. This model is also available in only three colors:  Starlight, Midnight, and Red.
