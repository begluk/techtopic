title: Samsung's new Galaxy A33, A53 and A73 phones
---

On March 17, Samsung announced 3 new phones in the A-series. They finally expanded 5G into the budget market, with the Galaxy A33, A53, and A73. They all are a significant upgrade from the previous A-series phones. All three phones will get 4 years of Android OS support. These phones will introduce the 5nm manufacturing process for their chipset.

## Samsung Galaxy A73 5G

The A73 5G has a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 120Hz, which is an upgrade from the 90Hz of the previous model. It's powered by an octa-core Exynos processor paired with 6 or 8 GB of RAM. As far as storage goes, this phone will be available in both 128 GB and 256 GB models. The old 64-megapixel camera will be replaced with a new 108-megapixel camera, which is paired with a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The front camera is 32 megapixels, equal to that of the A72 model. The battery has a capacity of 5000 mAh with 25w quick charge support. The device should be available within the next month, but the prices are still unknown.

## Samsung Galaxy A53 5G

The galaxy A53 5G sports a little smaller 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 120Hz. It's powered by an octa-core processor, which should improve night photography quality, as reported by Samsung. On the back are the already familiar system of 4 cameras - 64-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and depth and macro cameras of 5 megapixels both. Along with software improvements, this should make this phone good for photos. This model has a battery capacity of 5000 mAh with 25w quick charge capabilities. In Germany, the price for the 6/128 GB model should be 450 euro, while the 8/256 GB version will have a price of 510 euro. This phone will have a microSD card slot, allowing you to expand the storage.

The display of the A33 will also be a little smaller, this time at 6.4 inches. The display will be AMOLED FHD+, just like the other versions, but this time with a refresh rate of 90Hz. Let's remind ourselves that the A32 had an LCD HD+ display with a refresh rate of 60Hz, making this a significant improvement over the last generation. A33 has a main camera of 48 megapixels, an ultrawide of 8 megapixels, a macro of 5 megapixels, and a depth camera of 2 megapixels. The front camera has a quality of 13 megapixels.
