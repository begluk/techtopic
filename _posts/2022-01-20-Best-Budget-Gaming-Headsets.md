A good headset is essential to every gamer. But not all of us have the money to spend on good gaming headsets, so TechTopic brings you the Top 5 best budget headsets. The most important qualities of a headset are comfort, audio quality, and microphone quality. We have assured you that all of the headsets listed below have those qualities and that you won't fool yourself if you buy either one of them.

### 1. SteelSeries Arctis 1

The SteelSeries Arctis 1 headset renders great audio for gaming, watching videos and movies, listening to music, and much more. We have found this headset to be quite an immersive experience. The detachable microphone isn't exceptional, but it works very well. It's comfortable for hours on end, and we sincerely recommend this headset for those looking for a high-quality budget headset. This headset comes in both wired and wireless versions.

### 2. Razer Barracuda X

The Razer Barracuda X is a bit more pricey, but it's a great choice nonetheless. This headset is very versatile, it is designed for seamless use across many different platforms, such as PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and much more. It comes with a flexible boom microphone of great quality. The battery can last up to 20 hours on a single charge, making battery life a non-issue. Unfortunately, the wireless does not work with Xbox, so you will have to use a 3.5mm cable if you wish to use it with the Xbox.

### 3. Corsair HS35

The HS35 is currently the cheapest Corsair headset available. Corsair is known for making great gaming accessories, and they certainly did not disappoint with their HS35 Gaming Headset for this price range. The headset is comfortable for long gaming hours, and although a little too bassy, the sound quality is above average for this price range. The microphone is removable and sounds great for this price. This headset does not come with any wireless functionality, for that we would recommend the [Corsair HS70 Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-HS70-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B07X9W721J).

### 4. SteelSeries Arctis 3

With SteelSeries, it's hard to go wrong. The SteelSeries Arctis 3 is really just a better version of the Arctis 1. This headset has noticeably better sound quality than the Arctis 1, and also feels more comfortable. The wireless version has a 28 hour long battery life, and supports Bluetooth 4.1. The wired version uses a 3.5mm jack, which is not an issue in most cases, but can make setting up SteelSeries Engine Software a hassle. If you want USB, for only $20 more you can get the [SteelSeries Arctis 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FZQJ8PY).

Last but not the least on our list is the HyperX Cloud Stinger. Coming at an affordable price of just $29.99 as of December 2021, it comes with great bang for the buck. It used to be the go-to choice for budget headphones, and even 5 years later it's still a great choice. It has a swivel-to-mute microphone with noise cancellation. Thanks to its plastic design, it's quite lightweight and comfortable to use for hours on end. Unfortunately it does not have a wireless verion, it only has a wired (3.5mm jack) version.
