On November 10, 2020, Microsoft unveiled the Xbox Series X. The console solidified itself as the "best Xbox of all times", it was a leap forward in console tech, with hardware that was much better than previous versions. The Xbox Series X comes at a price of $500, $200 more than it's smaller and more budget friendly counterpart, the Xbox Series S. It's capable of 120fps gameplay, assuming your TV supports that high of a framerate. The targeted resolution is 4K at 60fps, making gameplay crisp and smooth. The Xbox measures at 15.1 x 15.1 x 30.1 centimeters, making it look quite bulky. It's easy to mistake it for a small factor PC. The Xbox Series X also has substantially faster loading times than previous versions. 

## Games

The Xbox Series X now has many games that showcase what Microsoft's new hardware can do. Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, Psychonauts 2, and Microsoft Flight Simulator are now all available, and Microsoft has upgraded many older Xbox One games to for full support of the new console's specifications. Even though Xbox Game Pass contains mostly older titles, a lot of games are optimized to take advantage of the new Xbox's hardware, such as Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4, and Sea of Thieves, so it's a great place to experience next-gen games. Unlike a high end gaming PC, the Xbox Series X has the benefit of being only $500, not to mention the $300 Xbox Series S. For gaming the new Xbox is truly the king. Recent Microsoft's acquirings of gaming studios is going to vastly expand the library of availabe games for the Xbox.

## Design

The Xbox measures at 15.1 x 15.1 x 30.1 centimeters, making it look quite bulky. The console has a mesh design on the top, that acts as a vent. The console can be positioned both horizonally and vertically, because it has rubber pads both on the side. The fan of the console is *really, really* quiet, to the point where it's barely noticeable even if you focus on it. The design doesn't really stick out much, the simple aesthetic is certianly going to stand the test of time well.

## I/O


As far as I/O goes, the Xbox has as many ports as you need. It has only one USB 3.1 port and a Blu-ray drive on the front. At the back you can find more ports. There are 2 USB ports, handy for external storage. The HDMI 2.1 port at the back supports up to 8K at 120fps. There's an ethernet port, which is the recommended connection option for online gaming. One interesting feature of the Xbox Series X is the expansion port. It allows you to add a proprietary external SSD, if you ever need extra storage on the console.

## Performance

The Xbox Series X sports a Custom AMD Zen 2 octa core CPU at 3.8GHz. It has 16GB of RAM which is much more than enough for gaming on a console. The GPU is RDNA 2 based, and it's performance comes at an impressive 12 teraflops. These numbers alone mean nothing, so let's talk gaming. All tested games run excellent on the Xbox Series X. The console utilizes dynamic resolution, switching between 4K and 1440p mid-game to keep a steady framerate. It's not even noticeable under normal use. You should not worry about game performance if you buy this console.
