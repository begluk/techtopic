In February, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S22 series, which includes three models: the normal Galaxy S22, the Galaxy S22 Plus, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra.The Galaxy S22 Ultra has gotten the most interest, owing to the fact that it's another Note-style phone, and it's been a year and a half since the last Galaxy Note phones reached shop shelves.The entry-level Galaxy S22, with a starting price of $799.99, is the one to get if you want a top-tier Android phone without spending over a thousand dollars. 
This year's Galaxy S22 isn't all that different from last year's Galaxy S21, which was only a tiny upgrade over the Galaxy S20.All Galaxy S22 phones come with the same fast Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset (and Exynos 2200 in select territories), three back cameras, a 6.1-inch AMOLED screen, and four Android OS updates (plus five years of security patches).The Galaxy S22 is one of the best bang-for-your-buck smartphones on the market right now, especially considering the extended software support, but there are a few flaws. 

## Design and Display

The Galaxy S22 features a 6.1-inch display, which is 0.1 inch smaller than the Galaxy S20. The change is so subtle that you wouldn't notice it unless you compared the two handsets side by side.The panel uses AMOLED technology and boasts an FHD+ resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 240Hz touch input rate. 
The Contour Cut camera panel, the lack of a 3.5mm headphone port, and the flat-edged front are all design features that the S22 shares with the S21.
One minor change is that the phone's back is now made of glass rather than plastic, giving it a more premium feel in the hand while also making it a little heavier. The phone comes in four colors: Phantom Black, Phantom White, Pink Gold, and Green.

## Camera 
The main camera has been upgraded from a 12MP sensor to a 50MP sensor, as well as a switch to a better sensor design, which should result in brighter and bolder standard photographs.The telephoto camera has been downgraded from 64MP to 10MP, but with a stronger optical zoom of 3x compared to the S21's 1.1x.

## Battery
The battery capacity is a very small 3,700mAh, down 300mAh from last year's edition, and we have to hope Samsung has made some adjustments to ensure that battery life isn't compromised. The charging speed is 25W, which isn't fast compared to what some competitors provide, but it should be faster than the S21 due to the phone's smaller battery.

## Specifications and Performance
For the S22 series, Samsung is adhering to its two-chipset policy: those in the US and Asia will get the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, while those in Europe and the rest of the globe will get Samsung's own Exynos 2200.Although the Exynos chip is slightly less powerful than the Snapdragon, most users will not notice.Both are high-end processors with enough of horsepower for gaming, video editing, and AI work. 

## Software
Both chips come with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, depending on the model you choose, as well as 5G capability. The software is Samsung's One UI, which will be familiar to owners of the company's devices, and it's running on Android 12.
