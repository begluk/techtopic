The Xiaomi 12 is launched in China in December, but we waited for the final launch for an international audience. It’s still not clear when it is coming to shelves, but we expect it in the coming weeks. Xiaomi 12 is an interesting phone, especially since Xiaomi moves its boundaries every year. For the price of around $750, we get something that just Xiaomi can pack at that price.

## Design

We are pleased with the design, the colors are nice and match with the phone itself. It comes in blue, black, green or pink. The display comes in 6.28 inches, in comparison to other phones we find this size just perfect. It’s an AMOLED panel with FHD resolution. From all of this, we found that the most attractive detail is the 120Hz display which is more than pleasing to use. For protection, we have Gorilla Glass Victus in front and Gorilla Glass 5 in the back.

## Camera

It comes with a 50MP camera, which is a big change from the last series 108MP, but as we seemed, photos are just much brighter and cleaner than the last series. Besides the main camera, we have a 13MP ultrawide camera, and 5MP telemacro snapper. Both of these come in handy sometimes. We believe that this camera won’t disappoint you, it surely didn’t disappoint us.

## Battery

When we talk about batteries we found that Xiaomi has put a lot of effort into creating a battery that will satisfy everyone’s needs. This time we have 4.500mAh and it comes with incredible 67W wired or 50W wireless charging. This charging speed is one of the biggest we have seen, and if we take into consideration the price range it is surely taking 1st place.

## Software and Hardware specs

Now the main thing. The processor is a snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, which is high-end. For this beast, mobile gaming will be the peace of cake. Next, we have 8GB RAM, and 128GB storage in the regular version, but you can also take 8GB/256GB or 12GB/256GB. We found speakers to be loud enough, and the nice thing is they are stereo, which today is not too often in this price range. The software is classic MIUI and Android 12, which are the newest version. The interface itself is clean and easy to use. In the end, we believe in this price range, this phone is high-end.
