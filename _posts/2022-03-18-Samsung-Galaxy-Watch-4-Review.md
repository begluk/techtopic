Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is a continuation of Samsung's smart watch line; this watch was created with Google's assistance. The watch runs on Wear OS, which has been upgraded and renamed One UI Watch 3. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 does not have any significant software or hardware advancements, but that does not make it a terrible device. Furthermore, the watch has an excellent design and is suited for usage because of the features it offers. Samsung's concept was to showcase a single top watch that included the Tizen platform and Wear OS. They have achieved this in certain aspects of the watch, but not in others; one of these issues may be the watch's compatibility, which can be problematic for some users. However, there are benefits such as a long battery life and a stylish and comfy design. We'll go through each feature individually in the next review.

## Design

The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is available in two variants, each with a revised bezel that ensures a smooth transition from the watch shell to the straps. The Galaxy Watch 4 pays respect to previous Galaxy Watch models despite these modest differences. The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic's swivel frame is a great navigation tool.  Even if we're only talking about regular watches, the current design that they introduce can be difficult. When you consider the additional needs for smartwatch technology's size, it's all too simple for the manufacturer to go overboard with glitzy embellishments. While both styles are likely to appeal to some buyers, I favor the Watch4 for its understated simplicity. Although this faceless watch is still as thick as a smart watch, the combination of the narrowed bottom and the way the watch strap wraps around the sides of the body provides the impression of a much simpler design.

## Display

Samsung chose an AMOLED panel for this watch, which is brilliant and vibrant even in direct sunshine, with very strong colors that make the most of the large number of watch faces available - over 20 out of the box, with plenty more to download. The 40mm model has a 1.2-inch panel with a resolution of 396x396, while the 44mm model has a 1.4-inch panel with a resolution of 450x450.
So we never felt like we are missing out on anything by turning off the Always ond Display because both the wake-up and wake-up touch options function well. Other display options, such as improved touch sensitivity for glove use or a water lock to inhibit touch input while swimming or bathing, suggest that Samsung has thought about other concerns that a touch-sensitive smartwatch could pose.

## Software

The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is the first watch to run Google's Wear OS 3 operating system.
Wear OS 3 is the product of a collaboration between Google and Samsung, which earlier developed their own smartwatch operating system, TizenOS. However, Wear OS 3 has not yet been officially released and will not be until 2022, therefore this watch runs on Samsung's Wear OS. This is the first look at Google's makeover in terms of functionality, although with Samsung's top look. This means you'll get Samsung's One UI Watch experience instead of Google's, which means navigating the Galaxy Watch 4 is something like navigating Samsung's Galaxy phones.

## Specifications and Performance

When it comes to smart watches, specifications aren't as significant as they once were. That does not, however, imply that we should disregard them. As a result, Samsung has changed the Exynos W920 chip in the Galaxy Watch 4 to a smaller and more efficient 5nm processor. It should imply not just increased strength but also increased energy efficiency at work. So, this smartwatch has 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which is a terrific feature for a smartwatch; all of these qualities allow it to run smoothly without any delays. Bluetooth 5.0 is also supported, as well as Wi-Fi.

## Battery Performance

Samsung did not disappoint us when it came to the battery, which may last for up to 40 hours depending on how you use the watch. Even with all of the options turned on, such as battery sleep monitoring, it will take at least 24 hours. The "Always On Display" option will dramatically lower the battery's performance, as well as the frequency with which you may measure your heart rate, listen to music, send messages, and more. It takes around an hour and a half to fully charge the battery, which is very reliable. However, with the relatively quick chargers available nowadays, we believe it should have been better. We are hopeful that this will improve with the new model. It is also important to note that wireless charging is also supported.

## Pricing 

The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is presently available worldwide, with prices varying depending on size and LTE choices. The watch comes in a variety of colors, and some authorized wholesalers, such as Amazon, allow you to create your own strap combination.
